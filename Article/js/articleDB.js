Our great nation has witnessed a number of similar incidents in the past and has comfortably dealt with them. This is nothing, Rouhani said in a meeting with Iranian members of parliament on Monday.															Rouhani has called for calm as his government deals with the widespread spontaneous uprising.																										                                                                                                    							-- A man creating a disturbance shot at police Monday with a hunting rifle, killing one officer and wounding three others, according to state media.

There was confetti and sparkly nude illusion dresses and a little gospel choir and expert vocalization. It was all very on-brand.																						 																																							But perhaps nothing was more on-brand than when Mariah paused between songs to ask for some hot tea.									 																																												They told me there would be tea she said, looking perplexed. Despite the hellish cold of the evening, there was not.					 																																											Oh, it's a disaster. Okay, well, we'll just have to rough it. I'm going to be like everybody else, with no hot tea."

Director Ava DuVernay, producer Kathleen Kennedy and dozens of actors, including America Ferrera, Emma Stone and Constance Wu, laid out the mission of Time's Up in an open letter.																					 																																														The women said they were encouraged to find ways to battle harassment in all industries after receiving a letter of support from Alianza Nacional de Campesinas (The National Farmworker Women's Alliance) in November.																								 																																													In that letter, the alliance acknowledged the outpouring of stories about gender-based violence and discrimination in entertainment, but wrote, sadly, we're not surprised because it's a reality we know far too well.																						Countless farmworker women across our country suffer in silence because of the widespread sexual harassment and assault that they face at work, the alliance's letter read."

	articleBody :"Known as Las Pe√±as in the 1800s, it was renamed after former state governor Ignacio Vallarta in the early 1900s. As a fishing town, Puerto Vallarta's main source of pesos, in addition to fishing, was agricultural exports such as bananas, coconuts and corn. These days, it relies on importing tourists, hypnotized by the green turquoise seawater. 			 	 																																														Blame Hollywood. Stars such as Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner descended on Banderas Bay to film John Huston's The Night of the Iguana.																																								 																																												Soon enough, the paparazzi caught whiff of Taylor and Burton's blossoming love affair with each other -- and their new second home. Others followed suit, including investors. 																																			 																																											Flash-forward several decades later and cue the mariachi bands that tame tourists with exotic festive sounds, all-inclusive resorts with sandy beaches and watered-down drinks. But the Puerto Vallarta that Burton and Taylor in fell with is so much more, if only you look beyond the confines of your resort when you travel here."
